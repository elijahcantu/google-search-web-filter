# Google Search Web Filter Redirector
Redirects Google searches to the Web filter, which contains text-based links to websites. Google Searchâ€™s Web filter does not include sections such as 'AI Overview.' Searches entered in the address bar or New Tab page are redirected to the Web filter. After performing a search, you can switch to other filters. Searches entered in the search box on the search results page or Google domains will not be redirected to the Web filter.
