# Google Search Web Filter Redirector
Google Search’s Web filter does not include sections such as 'AI Overview.' Searches entered in the address bar or New Tab page are redirected to the Web filter. After performing a search, you can switch to other filters. Searches entered in the search box on the search results page or Google domains will not be redirected to the Web filter.
