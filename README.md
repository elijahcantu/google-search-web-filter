# Google Search Web Filter
Redirects Google searches to the Web filter, which contains text-based links to websites.<br> Google Search Web Filter is available on the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-search-web-filter/cnailmoibfjlnlnjedbgbjbononifola" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-search-web-filter/" target="_blank">Firefox Add-ons</a>.
## Features
- Removes sections such as AI Overview, Images, Videos, Top stories, Local news, etc.
- Removes tracking parameters from the URLs of Google searches.
- Ability to change the filter after you search (e.g., Images filter).
- Redirects to the Web filter when you search using the address bar or New Tab page search box.
- The extension does not redirect to the Web filter when you use the search box on the search results page, allowing you to continue searching under a different filter (e.g., Images) without having to switch back to it after each search.

## Caveats
- To use Google Search tools (e.g., calculator, unit converter, color picker, etc.), you need to switch to the All filter after performing a search.
- Based on the structure of Google Search URLs, searches entered directly on Google domain homepages (e.g., google.com) will not be redirected to the Web filter. Implementing this feature would also redirect you back to the Web filter when switching to a different filter after a search.
